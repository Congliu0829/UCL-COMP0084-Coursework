# UCL-COMP0084-Coursework

These are the courseworks for Module COMP0084 Information Retrieval and Data Mining. There are two courseworks in general. In the first coursework, different information retrieval methods, including TF-IDF, BM25 are implemented to retreive passages according to queries. Likelihood language models are also implemented to retrieve passages.

The second coursework implements machine learning-based methods for query-passage pairing, including logistic regression, xgboost and transformer-based neural networks.
